### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michelle
I am currently a computer engineering student at the University of California - Riverside. I am planning to graduate in 2021 and will be looking for internships/full-time positions starting then. I don't have a specific thing I want to do since I like just making things, not anything speciifc. However, I am passionate about things like creating software to help people. 

## :computer::electric_plug:
I have done some projects and I'm currently looking to add more to refine my knowledge on all things. Some of my projects you can find in my repositories.I'm always open to learn new things and to do something that may be out of my comfort zone! I'm comfortable with 
* C++
* C
* Linux
* Git
* Some Pyhton
* Some Verilog
* Breadboarding 
* Circuit Analysis
* Etc.
